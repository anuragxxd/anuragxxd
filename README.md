# Hi, I am Anurag 

I'm a University Student in India, pursuing Computer Science as an interest. I've been actively involved as an open-source contributor to different projects, where I am trying to solve the problems faced by the community and improve my skills. I've been doing this since around 2019.

Other than that, I like to read mythologies & play games.

My goal with GitHub is to be able to study and to work with OSS that is essential to the web continuing to thrive.

Thanks for taking time to read this. Follow me to hear more about me. :)
